# Custom CNN and Transformer Models

This repository contains implementations of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST dataset and a custom Transformer model for text data. Both models utilize custom layers and are built using PyTorch.

## Installation

To install the required packages, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Usage

To train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset, run the following command:

```bash
python custom_cnn.py
```

To train the Transformer model on a simple text dataset, run the following command:

```bash
python custom_transformer.py
```
